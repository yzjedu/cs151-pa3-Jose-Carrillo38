Objective:
The objective of this assignment was to practice using loops, designing and implementing functions, and protecting against bad user input. We were tasked with creating a program that could display different ASCII art designs based on user choices. The program required options for generating a circle, a customizable set of lines, and a random design from three different patterns. This assignment helped reinforce modularity in programming by breaking down tasks into individual functions, which made the code more organized and reusable.

Procedure:
To tackle this problem, I followed an incremental approach instead of writing the entire program in one go. I started by designing a basic menu function to prompt the user for input and validate their choices. Then, I created each design option one by one. After writing each function, I tested it separately to ensure it worked as expected before moving on to the next. This approach helped me identify errors early and made debugging easier. For instance, I tested each ASCII design individually to make sure it displayed correctly. I also used input validation techniques, such as checking if the user input was a digit and fell within the allowed range, to prevent crashes.

Key Concepts Explored:
The key concepts explored in this lab were looping, generating visual output, and practicing good human-computer interaction (HCI) principles. Using loops allowed me to repeat patterns in the ASCII designs, and by making each design look visually appealing and clean, I aimed for an intuitive user experience. Good HCI practices were essential to ensure the program was easy to navigate and handled incorrect input gracefully.

Results:
The final program worked as expected, and the random design feature added a nice, unpredictable element that displayed one of three unique ASCII designs each time it was chosen. Although I did not try extreme test cases, I brainstormed shapes and patterns to mimic the desired visual output with print statements. This approach helped me keep the designs simple and achievable with basic loops and print formatting.

Reflection:
One challenge I faced was understanding how to use random.randint effectively, especially since I hadnâ€™t used it much before. It required a bit of common sense to convert the concept of randomness into code, especially to select one design out of three. My code may not look extremely polished, but it is efficient and relatively straightforward, following the three main rules of programming: simplicity, efficiency, and readability. One takeaway is that understanding loops and functions deeply can make such assignments significantly easier and more manageable.

Overall, I believe I learned what I was supposed to for this lab. Working alone allowed me to track my progress clearly without worrying about coordination issues with others. While I prefer collaborating, solo work allowed me to control each part of the assignment at my own pace.
